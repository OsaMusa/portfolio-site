									<h3>Problem</h3>
									When appealing the values of parcels, consultants will need to provide their evidence in a format that explains their points. This is
									done in the form of a narrative that includes the counter values and the methodologies behind how they came to them. The process of
									creating these narratives was made more repeatable by having the calculations done in Excel workbooks that would have the results in a
									format that was ready to be copied and pasted into a Word document. Then, the consultant would make the necessary edits based on the
									factors they felt applied to the case. The resulting evidence report could be created by an experienced consultant in about 1 and a
									half hours. With the company growing, this was unsustainable and difficult to train new consultants on. The company needed a way to
									reduce the time taken to create these evidence reports that was simple enough for new hires to quickly complete. 
									<br><br>
									<h3>Solution</h3>
									Because making the narratives was done using Microsoft Office applications, I utilized Visual Basic to automate the process. The macro
									for the legacy format was housed within an Excel file that had a list of options for what sections of the narrative to include. Newer
									Excel files would be made with the macro built into them before being distributed to the consultants. Based on what the consultant would
									choose to include, the macro would then open a Word document and fill out the narrative. This was done by having the macro search for
									created tags had replace them with the associated information from the Excel workbook in the appropriate format. The information
									transferred was not limited to text, but was also charts, images, tables, etc. The macro also included the option to create a PDF copy
									of the created evidence report and combine it with supporting files. 
									<br><br>
									<h3>Result</h3>
									The consultants became able to create evidence reports by simply deciding what parts of their Excel based calculations they wanted to
									include, and then clicking the button to run the macro. With this macro, the time needed to complete the process of transferring Excel
									calculation into an evidence report was dropped to about one minute. Furthermore, they were then able to more easily train the novice
									consultants to create competent narratives in preparation for appeal hearings.
