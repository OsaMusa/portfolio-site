									<h1>Outlook Automation</h1>
									<p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large;"><b>Project for: </b>Altus Group</p>

									<h3>Problem</h3>
									The company had its scheduled hearings stored on both a legacy database and Snowflake. In order to know which consultant
									should attend each hearing, as well as where and when, they would export the data from the database and have an assistant
									from the operations team manually enter the information into each consultant's Outlook calendar. This process cost these
									employees several hours each day, and was prone to input errors. operations needed a way to reduce the workload for the
									assistants while also reducing the errors that could risk hearings being missed. This solution would also need to have a
									way for management to be able to see and make updates to the calendar from a shared location.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Solution</h3>
									Utilized Alteryx to extract and transform hearing data from the company's Snowflake database, and then load it into a CSV file.
									To automate the process of adding the hearings to Outlook, a Visual Basic macro was developed. The macro would read the
									data from the CSV exported from Alteryx using Power Query, and use that information to generate a meeting invite in Outlook
									for each record of hearing data. The macro sent the meeting invites from an Outlook account made for the operations team to
									overlook the hearing calendar. It also would record the global appointment ID that Outlook would assign to the meetings and
									use them for tracking changes in the schedules. The automation was made to be cyclical. Alteryx would use the Excel file
									to compare the hearings to see if they had Outlook IDs, and make any necessary changes.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Result</h3>
									The consultants were able to more easily get a clear picture of when they had hearings and better avoid missing them. The
									operations team was no longer spending time entering hearings into the consultants' personal calendars and could focus on other
									tasks. They and management were given access to the calendar of the account sending the meeting invites; thus, allowing them to
									have complete oversight of the hearings and be able to see when changes should be made.
