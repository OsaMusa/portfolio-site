									<h1>Ticketing System</h1>
									<p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large;"><b>Project for: </b>Altus Group</p>
								</header>
								<p>
									<h3>Problem</h3>
									The company had a small technology team that would be sent a variety of requests from the rest of the teams nationwide. These requests would
									vary from quick tasks from the consulting team to large projects from the operations team. With the large demand on such a small team, there
									would be requests that could not be addressed as there was no standard for submissions. The team needed a way to keep track of what requests
									were coming in as well as who the projects would be assigned to.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Solution</h3>
									Utilized Microsoft Forms and Power Automate to create a ticketing system for the technology team that would automatically add requests
									submitted via the associated forms to the team's SharePoint List for tracking. Additional Power Automate flows were created to email status
									updates regarding the requests to the people who submitted them. A Power BI report was also made to visualize the number of projects and
									upcoming deadlines for the team's management staff.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Result</h3>
									The team is now able to see what projects are being submitted and properly prioritize them in accordance with their capacity. Managers
									have a clearer picture of what each team member's project list looks like and can accept/reject requests accordingly.
