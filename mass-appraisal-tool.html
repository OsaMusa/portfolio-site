									<h1>Mass Appraisal Tool</h1>
									<p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large;"><b>Project for: </b>Altus Group</p>
								</header>

									<h3>Problem</h3>
									The company's consultants conduct appraisals of properties in Excel and compare their results to those of an assessor to judge whether an
									appeal should be filed. The operations team would update property information within the company database which allowed for consultants to
									export their list of assigned properties. With the company's growing client base, appraising all a consultant's assigned properties becomes
									a more time-consuming process, especially for consultants servicing clients with several dozen properties each. They were not able to manage
									the growing number of properties they were being assigned to, and needed a way to appraise their properties that would allow individuals to
									quickly assess whether they had a case for any appeals.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Solution</h3>
									Because the consultants were all more familiar with using Excel for their valuations, and had them based on exports from the database, an
									Excel workbook was made that would look at all the properties in those exports. It primarily utilized a table with a multitude of calculated
									columns. This table would use the company's different valuation formulas to automatically calculate the value of each property as well as
									highlight when a property's value based on those methods was less than what was proposed by the assessor. It also allowed for any necessary
									changes to be made in what ways specific properties were being evaluated. The workbook also had other sheets meant for the more detailed
									phases of the evaluations available for when the consultant chose a property to appeal.
									<br><br>
									<h3>Result</h3>
									The tool led to an increase in productivity as the consultants were able to evaluate a high volume of properties at once utilizing it. The
									table prevented them from wasting precious time appraising properties that would have little to no value reductions by immediately showing
									them the results of their valuation methodology; thus, allowing them to focus on high value properties.
