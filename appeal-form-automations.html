									<h1>Appeal Form Automations</h1>
									<p style="text-align: center; font-size: x-large;"><b>Project for: </b>Altus Group</p>
								</header>

									<h3>Problem</h3>
									There are a large number of properties to be appealed and the company must notify the assessor that they are going to be
									representing the client in the hearing. Despite how the notification forms for this process are in a standard format,
									that standard is different for each assessor and appeal type. Filling out these forms is a time-consuming process and only
									becomes worse each year, as new business comes in. The consultant team need a way to quickly fill out the forms for each
									of their properties with minimal human error. 
									<br><br>
									<h3>Solution</h3>
									Utilized Power Query in Excel to extract, transform, and load the data from the company's database to create a CSV to be
									used with the Evermap AutoMailMergeâ„¢ software. The Evermap software was used to fill out the PDF form and create a
									completed form for each listed property. Then a Visual Basic macro was run to combine the resulting PDF with its associated
									supporting files. This was made to be handled by the use of a Windows batch (.bat) file to allow for non-technical employees
									to accomplish the task with the ease of clicking the file. 
									<br><br>
									<h3>Result</h3>
									The team was able to complete their appeal forms for the applicable properties more quickly than in prior years. The process
									is now able to be done by one team member, and with its simplicity, the team was able to more easily transfer the process to
									new team members.
