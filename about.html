									<h1>About me</h1>
								</header>
								<p>
									During my time in the insurance industry, I learned the importance of being able to explain specialized concepts in 
									simple terms. I was able to use active listening to understand not only the needs of clients, but also to understand 
									and address any concerns they may have had. I found my passion for working with data when I was asked to create 
									a strategy to bring in more new clients. Looking through how my team operated, and putting numbers to the 
									actions taken, opened my eyes to how powerful data analysis is for a business.
									<br><br>
									Since my time in insurance, I have transitioned into a data based role were I could better utilize these skills. With 
									how I have always enjoyed learning new ways to grow, I still try to find time to further hone my analysis skills 
									through the use of personal projects and certifications. This site is how I plan to demonstrate my growth as a data 
									professional through sharing some of these projects.
